## Description

I wanted to prepare myself for my upcoming coding bootcamp by challenging myself to build something with my minimal coding skills. This website provides a brief overview of some of the information I learned while preparing for the aformentioned bootcamp and will be useful as a review tool in the future. In the process of building it, I learned some basic skills in using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git/Github.
