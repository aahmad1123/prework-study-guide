        <h2>HTML</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>HTML is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
      <li>The head element contains information about the webpage (metadata). Inside the head element we can use the following metadata tags:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
            <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
            <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
            <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
            <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
            <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>h1, h2, h3, etc.: Heading elements</li>
          <li>p: paragraph or block of text</li>
          <li>ul, ol, li: unordered list, ordered list, list item</li>
          <li>img: contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes</li>
          <li>br: a line break</li>
          <li>a: anchor- creates links to the same or other webpages</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
      <li>The element that holds all the children is known as the parent element.</li>
      <li>Semantic HTML elements describe the content and role that element plays on a webpage. Ex. The body element</li>
      <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag. These tags are most often represented by angle brackets with associated tag names contained inside.</li>
      <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They’re useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head</li>
          <li>a selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page we use a special wild card symbol, * , as the selector</li>
          <li>You can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>

          <li> a variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
          <li>Then we use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
          <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon</li>
          <li>string= a sequence of text.  To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks.</li>
          <li>methods are actions that can be performed on objects</li>
